# Vercel ASGI Compatibility Fix

## Problem Analysis

Based on the logs from `logs_result.json`, the deployment was failing with:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/var/task/vc__handler__python.py", line 218, in <module>
if not issubclass(base, BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class
```

## Root Cause

The error occurred in Vercel's Python handler (`vc__handler__python.py`) at line 218, where it was trying to inspect our FastAPI application object. The issue was:

1. **ASGI/WSGI Compatibility**: Vercel's serverless function runtime expects a specific handler format
2. **Object Inspection Failure**: The `issubclass()` check was failing because our FastAPI app object wasn't being recognized as a proper class
3. **Handler Format**: Direct FastAPI app assignment (`handler = app`) doesn't work with Vercel's runtime inspection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Mangum ASGI Adapter

**File**: `api/index.py`
```python
# Before (problematic)
handler = app

# After (fixed)
from mangum import Mangum
handler = Mangum(app, lifespan="off")
```

### 2. Updated Dependencies

**File**: `requirements.txt`
```
+ mangum==0.17.0
```

## Why This Works

1. **Mangum**: A library specifically designed to adapt ASGI applications (like FastAPI) for AWS Lambda and Vercel serverless functions
2. **Proper Handler Format**: Mangum creates a handler that Vercel's runtime can properly inspect and execute
3. **Lifespan Management**: `lifespan="off"` prevents startup/shutdown event conflicts in serverless environment
4. **ASGI Compatibility**: Ensures proper request/response handling in Vercel's serverless context

## Key Insights from Logs

- Our module imports were working correctly ("Successfully imported modules using direct imports")
- The crash occurred in Vercel's handler inspection, not in our application code
- The error was consistent across all requests, indicating a fundamental compatibility issue
- The problem was at the ASGI/serverless function interface level

## Testing the Fix

1. **Health Check**: Visit `/health` endpoint to verify basic functionality
2. **API Endpoints**: Test `/api/transcript` and `/api/format` endpoints
3. **Error Monitoring**: Check Vercel logs for any remaining issues

## Expected Outcome

With this fix:
- Vercel should properly recognize and execute our handler
- The `issubclass()` error should be resolved
- FastAPI application should run correctly in Vercel's serverless environment
- All API endpoints should be accessible and functional

This solution addresses the core ASGI compatibility issue that was preventing our FastAPI application from running on Vercel's serverless platform.
