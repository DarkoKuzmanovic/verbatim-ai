# Serverless Function Crash Fix

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing with:
```
500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
```

## Root Cause
The serverless function was crashing during initialization due to:
1. **Eager service initialization** - Services were being initialized at module import time
2. **Import path issues** - Module imports were failing in the Vercel environment
3. **Lack of error handling** - No graceful fallback when imports or initialization failed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Lazy Loading
- Changed from eager to lazy initialization of `YouTubeTranscriptFetcher` and `LLMFormatter`
- Services are now only initialized when first requested
- Prevents crashes during module import

### 2. Robust Import Handling
- Added fallback import mechanism using `importlib.util`
- Implemented dummy classes as last resort to prevent complete failure
- Enhanced logging to track import success/failure

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around service initialization
- Improved error messages with specific details
- Added startup event logging for debugging

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- Added startup event to log import status
- Enhanced health check endpoint with detailed service status
- Better logging throughout the application

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check Health Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /health
   ```
   Should return service status and import information

2. **Test Basic Functionality**
   ```
   GET /api/test
   ```
   Should return a simple test response

3. **Check Logs**
   - Monitor Vercel function logs for startup messages
   - Look for import success/failure messages

## Expected Behavior
- Function should start without crashing
- Health endpoint should show import status
- API endpoints should return proper error messages if services fail to initialize
- No more `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` errors

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
2. Test the health endpoint
3. Verify the API is responding
4. Set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable if not already set
5. Test full functionality with transcript fetching and formatting
